        This is a Progressive Web Application. Please add it to your home screen
        to make your life a bit easier. I put some steps below. The goal of this
        PWA is to have a simple, light weight, phone application that doesn’t
        overwhelm you with options, stats, or other information mid-round.
      </p>
      <p className="pl-4">
        My intent is to never require a username, password, or collect any data
        on any users. This application strictly uses the browser and its native
        Indexed Database to store the information you provide about your round
        or clubs.
      </p>
      <p className="pl-4">
        You can currently start a round, add holes to that round, and then save
        it. You can add clubs to your bag to track distances that you always
        forget just like me. You can also see previous rounds that you have
        saved.

          <li>You cannot edit holes mid-round.</li>

            No stat tracking on previous rounds like average FIR, GIR, Putts,
            etc.

            Offline support is not yet available, but I’m hoping to add it soon.

          I&apos;ll do my best to keep this list updated as I encounter issues
          or think of new features to add.
